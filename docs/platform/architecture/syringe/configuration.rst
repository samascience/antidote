Configuring Syringe
================================

Syringe is configured through environment variables. Since Syringe is typically deployed on Kubernetes, the best
way to pass these to Syringe is directly in the ``Pod`` or ``Deployment`` definition:

.. code:: yaml

    (...truncated...)

    containers:
    - name: syringe
      image: antidotelabs/syringe:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      env:
      - name: SYRINGE_CURRICULUM
        value: "/antidote"
      - name: SYRINGE_DOMAIN
        value: "localhost"

    (...truncated...)

If you're using `antidote-selfmedicate <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate>`_ to spin up an instance of Antidote and Syringe yourself, note that these are provided
in the included `vagrant manifest <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate/blob/master/antidote-config.yml>`_.
